	<h2 class="ac">Glorious history of Rath Yatra:</h2>
	<p  class="ad ae">Approximately four and a half hundred years ago, Ramanandi Sant Hanumandasji established the Gadi in the temple of Jagannathji in Jamalpur. After him on the throne, Sarangdasji established the idols of Balabhadraji, sister Subhadraji and Lord Jagannathji. After that this temple became famous as Jagannathji temple. Balamukundasji and then Narsimhdasji came to the throne of Mahat of this temple. Lord Jagannathji appeared to Narasimhdasji Maharaj in a dream and after that he started the Rath Yatra to Ashadhi. The first Rath Yatra took place in Ahmedabad 137 years ago. According to folklore, the devotees of the Khalas community living in Bharuch took the responsibility of the Rath Yatra on their heads. He prepared three chariots out of coconut trees, and placed brother Balabhadraji, sister Subhadraji and Prabhu Jagannathji in them. That chariot was made to travel by pulling sailor brothers. From then till today the work of chariot pulling is done by Khalas brothers.</p></br>
	
	<h2 class="ac"> How did Saraspur become God's monsoon?</h2>
	<p class="ad ae af">The Rath Yatra that started 137 years ago started on a very small scale. Narasimha Dasji Maharaj made the Lord sit in a bullock cart during the first Rath Yatra, in which monks participated. Ranchodji temple in Saraspur used to house all the monks' kitchen, since then Saraspur is considered as the mosal of Lord Jagannathji. Now God's mosal is performed every year in Ranchodji temple and up to 20 years of mosal has been booked till date. And now the residents of Saraspur from all parts of the world are constantly praying with love to all the future devotees who will participate in the Rath Yatra. Lakhs of charioteers are sent away after offering prasadi with love. Here you can see a wonderful atmosphere like God's food. </p></br>
